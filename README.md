# Crowdfunding_ETL
In this Project, I built an Extract, Transform, and Load pipeline using SQL, Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform crowdfunding data. After transforming the data, I created four CSV files and used the file data to create an Entity-Relationship-Diagram and a table schema. Finally, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
